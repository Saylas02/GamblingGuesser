  - Strategy and odds:
    - House edge:
      - In European Roulette, the house edge is typically 2.7%, because there is only one zero.
      - In American Roulette, the house edge is higher at around 5.26%, due to the presence of both a zero and a double zero.
    - Strategy:
      - While roulette is a game of chance, players often use betting strategies like the Martingale (doubling your bet after a loss) or the Fibonacci sequence to try to manage their risk, though these do not affect the house edge.
